# Hello World - Docker

Simple "hello world" inspired API that responses with "hello world" or "not found".

## Purpose

Why do we need another Hello World app? Well, we do not. However, this was a chance for me to better understand getting a Node/Express server working with docker and being able to deploy to a serverless provider.

## Getting Started

**Requirements**

- Node 12
- docker-cli

After cloning the project, install relevant dependencies using `npm install`.

#### Scripts

`npm run dev` - starts the development server.

For docker-cli commands, visit the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/).
